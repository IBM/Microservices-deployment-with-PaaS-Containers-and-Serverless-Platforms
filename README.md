# Navigate application deployment options with Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, OpenWhisk and Istio

PaaS platforms like Cloud Foundry, container orchestrators like Kubernetes, Serverless platforms like OpenWhisk and Service-mesh like Istio are all great technologies to deploy and manage your microservices on. Common wisdom says there is no such thing as too many choices, but abundance of choices can lead to analysis paralysis.  In this code, we look at deployment experience the different platforms provide, and what do we gain and lose by choosing one vs another.

We start with a sample Node.js monolithic application, Flightassist, factor it into two microservices, and then use it for demonstrating and comparing various deployment technologies. A set of trade-offs and comparisions can be made between these deployment models, and this application provides a basis for those discussions.

## Prerequisites

Register and obtain the keys for [FlightStats Developer API](https://developer.flightstats.com/signup) and [TripIt Developer API](https://www.tripit.com/developer/create) to query flight status.

When signing up for a FlightStats developer key, note that there is a review process that may take 24 hours or more to get your application credentials activated for a 30-day trial with the API.

## Deploy using DevOps Toolchain

Click the button to deploy your app and fill in all the variables from **Delivery Pipeline**. For Further instructions, please follow the [Toolchain instructions](https://github.com/IBM/container-journey-template/blob/master/Toolchain_Instructions_new.md).

[![Create Toolchain](https://github.com/IBM/container-journey-template/blob/master/images/button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

### Toolchain Scenarios One: Monolithic Application
You should see a link under the Cloud Foundry Deploy stage and that's where your application is hosting.

### Toolchain Scenarios Two: Microservices on Kubernetes Clusters, with or without Serverless capabilities

If you want to deploy with microservices, please leave the **OpenWhisk Auth** variable blank on **Delivery Pipeline**.
Otherwise, fill in the **OpenWhisk Auth** variable to enable serverless for your Flightassist.

Then, click **View logs and history** under Kubernetes Deploy stage in your pipeline to access your application via the URL link at the end of your logs.

# Steps

## Part A: Deploy, test and factor monolithic application into microservices:

1. [Provision application services - Cloudant Database and Insights for Weather Service](#1-create-your-cloudant-database-and-insights-for-weather-service)
2. [Deploy monolithic application](#2-deploy-monolithic-flightassist-application-using-cloud-foundry)
3. [Factor monolithic application into microservices and test](#3-factor-monolithic-application-into-microservices-and-test)

## Part B: Deploy microservices leveraging:

4. [Cloud Foundry](#4-deploy-flightassist-microservices-on-cloud-foundry)
5. [Kubernetes Cluster](#5-deploy-flightassist-microservices-on-kubernetes-cluster)
6. [Istio](#6-deploy-flightassist-microservices-on-istio)
7. [OpenWhisk](#7-deploy-flightassist-leveraging-openwhisk-functions)

After you deployed Flightassist using any platform, you can go to [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

# 1. Create your Cloudant Database and Insights for Weather Service

First, clone and get in our repository to obtain the necessary files and scripts for building this example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Microservices-deployment-with-PaaS-Containers-and-Serverless-Platforms.git && cd Microservices-deployment-with-PaaS-Containers-and-Serverless-Platforms
```

Since we need to create services using the command line, we need to install [Bluemix CLI](http://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html) before proceeding to the following steps.

We will use Bluemix's [The Cloudant NoSQL database service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south) and [Insights for Weather service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/weather-company-data?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south) for our database and weather data. Therefore, run the following commands to create cloudant and Insights for Weather service.

> For this example, we recommend you name your services to *mycloudant* and *myweatherinsights*.

```bash
bx service create cloudantNoSQLDB Lite mycloudant
bx service create weatherinsights Free-v2 myweatherinsights
```

Before moving on, the demo application is missing code to create the databases used to cache API responses in your newly created Cloudant instance. You can run the following commands with your cloudant URL to create the databases.

```bash
bx service key-create mycloudant {service key} #You can put any name for your {service key}
bx service key-show mycloudant {service key} #This will output your cloudant credential, "url" is Your cloudant URL
curl -k -X PUT {your-cloudantURL}/trips
curl -k -X PUT {your-cloudantURL}/weather
curl -k -X PUT {your-cloudantURL}/connections
```
# 2. Deploy monolithic Flightassist application using Cloud Foundry

In this scenario, we will deploy Flightassist as a monolithic application and host it on Cloud Foundry.

First, type the following commands to push your application with your own unique application name.

```bash
bx app push {your_unique_app_name} -f main_application/manifest.yml
```
> Note: If you want to use `cf` commands, please install [cloudfoundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) and run `cf push {your_unique_app_name} -f main_application/manifest.yml`

Now, go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps and select your application. Click the *Runtime* settings for your application and add these four environment variables to set up external credentials to the TripIt and FlightStats services:
   - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_ID` : application ID assigned by FlightStats
   - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_KEY` : application key assigned by FlightStats
   - `TRIPIT_API_KEY` : API key assigned by TripIt
   - `TRIPIT_API_SECRET` : API secret assigned by TripIt
   - `BASE_URL`: You URL for accessing your application. e.g. https://{app_name}.mybluemix.net/

Your application should restart automatically but can be done manually as well
in the UI. With the service bindings and added environment variables, the
application should be operational at the hostname route you selected for your CF
application.

Congratulations, now you can learn about [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

| [package.json](main_application/package.json)     | List the packages required by the application |
| [manifest.yml](main_application/manifest.yml)     | Description of the application to be deployed |

# 3. Factor monolithic application into microservices and test

To factor the application into microservices, we add a python microservice to the picture. Instead of directly accessing the apis from Node app, the python program will serve as a proxy to query. This step locally tests the app with the microservice and associated docker container images which are created.

First, install [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download).

Next, edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file and add your credentials for **FLIGHTSTATS_APP_ID**, **FLIGHTSTATS_APP_KEY**, **TRIPIT_API_KEY**,**TRIPIT_API_SECRET**,**CLOUDANT_URL**, and **WEATHER_URL**. Create a key for the weather service and then run the following command to view the service urls .

```bash
bx service key-create myweatherinsights {service key} #You can put any name for your {service key}
bx service key-show {service_name} {service key} #This will output your service credential, "url" is Your service URL
```

Then, run the following commands to build your docker images and run Docker Compose.

```bash
docker build -f main_application/Dockerfile.local -t flightassist main_application
docker build -f flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine -t weather-service flightassist-weather
docker-compose up
```
Now, your FlightAssist application should be running on http://localhost:3000/

# 4. Deploy Flightassist microservices on Cloud Foundry

Make sure you have both developer accounts mentioned in prerequisites. Also make sure you have cloudant and weatherinsights services created as listed in [step 1](#1-create-your-cloudant-database-and-insights-for-weather-service).

In this scenario, we take the Flightassist which is factored to use the Weather microservice. Since Cloud Foundry apps (warden containers) are not allowed to talk privately, they need to communicate via public route.

We first push the python microservice.
```
bx app push {your_unique_proxy_name} -f -f flightassist-weather/manifest.yml
```
> Note: If you want to use `cf` commands, please install [cloudfoundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) and replace all the `bx app push` command with `cf push`

**make sure you pick a unique name for the app.**   
This will bring up the first app we need.
The output should look like:
```
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 256M x 1 instances
urls: {proxy_name}.mybluemix.net
last uploaded: Thu Jun 8 21:36:15 UTC 2017
stack: unknown
buildpack: python_buildpack
```
And we need the **urls** for next step.   
Now we will push the second app, but **without starting** it.
```
bx app push {your_unique_app_name} -f main_application/manifest.yml --no-start
```
**make sure you pick a unique name for the app, too.**

Now we inject the environment variables as in monolithic deployment:
 - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_ID` : application ID assigned by FlightStats
 - `FLIGHTSTATS_APP_KEY` : application key assigned by FlightStats
 - `TRIPIT_API_KEY` : API key assigned by TripIt
 - `TRIPIT_API_SECRET` : API secret assigned by TripIt
 - `BASE_URL`: You URL for accessing your application. In the format **https://**{app_name}**.mybluemix.net/**

Plus, a couple more since we have two apps:
 - `USE_WEATHER_SERVICE`: true
 - `MICROSERVICE_URL`: {proxy_name}.mybluemix.net

Now we start the 2nd app:
`bx app start {app_name}`

You can now test the apps by going to http://<i>app_name</i>.mybluemix.net

## Code Structure

| File                                     | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [flightassist.js](main_application/flightassist.js)       | Main application, start the express web server and calling the major AJAX functions|
| All JavaScript files (main_application/*.js)         | The implementation of the flightstats, tripIt, and weather information, shared by all deployment options |
| [app.py](flightassist-weather/scr/app.py) | Weather Microservice, query and sent weather information to the main application |
| [Procfile and requirements.txt](flightassist-weather/)| Description of the microservice to be deployed |
| [package.json](main_application/package.json)     | List the packages required by the application |
| [manifest.yml](main_application/manifest.yml)     | Description of the application to be deployed |

## Takeaway points
To push an app, we simply use `bx app push` or `cf push` command. There is no container image or repository involved. Cloud Foundry has wide inventories of build packs to support different programming languages. If you run `cf marketplace`, you can find the huge list of services provided by Bluemix that can easily be consumed by your application. When pushing multi apps that need to communicate to each other, however, it is a little hacky. Another common alternative to creating public urls and sharing through environment variables as used in this example, is to bind a message queue service for communication.

# 5. Deploy Flightassist microservices on Kubernetes Cluster

In this scenario, we use the Flightassist microservices version which runs in two containers. We will run Flightassist as the main application with weather-service as a microservice to query the weather data. Then, we will host those containers using Kubernetes.

First, follow the [Kubernetes Cluster Tutorial](https://github.com/IBM/container-journey-template) to create your own cluster on Bluemix.

Then, install the container registry plugin for Bluemix CLI.

```bash
bx plugin install container-registry -r Bluemix
```
Next, build your own docker images and push them to your own bluemix container registry.

> Replace `<namespace>` with your own namespace, you can view your namespace by running `bx cr namespaces`
>
> If you have an unauthorized error, run `bx cr login` to authorized your container-registry.

```bash
docker build -f main_application/Dockerfile.local -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/flightassist main_application
docker build -f flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/weather-service flightassist-weather
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/flightassist
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/weather-service
```

Then, you need to run the following commands to bind your Cloudant and Weather Insights services to your clusters.

```bash
bx cs cluster-service-bind {your-cluster-name} default mycloudant
bx cs cluster-service-bind {your-cluster-name} default myweatherinsights
```

Next, create secret to give FlightStats and TripIt API credentials for Flightassist. Modify the secret.yaml file with **flightstats-app-id**, **flightstats-app-key**, **tripit-api-key**, and **tripit-api-secret**.

Then, edit the `flightassist.yaml` and replace the ```<namespace>``` with your own namespace. You can obtain your namespace by running `bx cr namespace`. Also replace `<your-app-end-point-url>` with your node ip and nodeport (e.g. 169.47.237.139:30080). You can obtain your IP by running `kubectl get nodes` and your nodeport is 30080.

Lastly, run the following commands to deploy the secret and deployment.

```bash
kubectl create -f secret.yaml
kubectl create -f flightassist.yaml
```

Congratulations, now your Flightassist application should be running on `http://<your_node_ip>:30080`. You can go to [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

## Code Structure

| File                                     | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [flightassist.js](main_application/flightassist.js)       | Main application, start the express web server and calling the major AJAX functions|
| All JavaScript files (main_application/*.js)         | The implementation of the flightstats and tripIt information, shared by all deployment options |
| [app.py](flightassist-weather/scr/app.py) | Weather Microservice, query and sent weather information to the main application |
| [package.json](main_application/package.json)         | List the packages required by the application |
| [Dockerfile.local](main_application/Dockerfile.local) and [Dockerfile.alpine](flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine) | Description of the Docker image |
| [flightassist.yaml](flightassist.yaml) and [secret.yaml](secret.yaml)| Specification file for the deployment of the service and secret in Kubernetes |


## Takeaway points
Kubernetes is a powerful orchestration tool. In this example we get a taste of the logical concept of clusters, creating a deployment, and service binding. It also has the container networking features built in. However, as a developer, you need to handle building container images and managing images in repositories.

# 6. Deploy Flightassist microservices on Istio

Istio is an open platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio is the result of a joint collaboration between IBM, Google and Lyft as a means to support traffic flow management, access policy enforcement and the telemetry data aggregation between microservices, all without requiring changes to the code

## 6.1 Installing Istio in your Cluster

### Download the Istio source
  1. Download the latest Istio release for your OS: [Istio releases](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases)  
  2. Extract and go to the root directory.
  3. Copy the `istioctl` bin to your local bin  
  ```bash
  $ cp bin/istioctl /usr/local/bin
  ## example for macOS
  ```

### Grant Permissions  
  1. Run the following command to check if your cluster has RBAC  
  ```bash
  $ kubectl api-versions | grep rbac
  ```  
  2. Grant permissions based on the version of your RBAC  
    * If you have an **alpha** version, run:

      ```bash
      $ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-rbac-alpha.yaml
      ```

    * If you have a **beta** version, run:

      ```bash
      $ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-rbac-beta.yaml
      ```

    * If **your cluster has no RBAC** enabled, proceed to installing the **Control Plane**.

### Install the [Istio Control Plane](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html#architecture) in your cluster  
```bash
kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio.yaml
cd ..
```
You should now have the Istio Control Plane running in Pods of your Cluster.
```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS
istio-egress-3850639395-30d1v     1/1       Running   0       
istio-ingress-4068702052-2st6r    1/1       Running   0       
istio-manager-251184572-x9dd4     2/2       Running   0       
istio-mixer-2499357295-kn4vq      1/1       Running   0       
```

## 6.2. Inject Istio Envoys on Flightassist.

**Important**: You must complete [scenario three: Microservices Kubernetes Clusters](#5-deploy-flightassist-microservices-on-kubernetes-cluster) in order to proceed to the following steps.

First, you want to delete all the services and deployments from the previous scenario.

```bash
kubectl delete -f flightassist.yaml
```

Now, grab your isito-ingress IP:Port.

```bash
echo $(kubectl get po -l istio=ingress -o jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}):$(kubectl get svc istio-ingress -o jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort})
```

Then, edit the `flightassist.yaml` file and replace your **BASE_URL** with `http://<isito-ingress IP:Port>`
> You also can remove `type:NodePort` on *flightassist-service* because we will access our application via isito-ingress.

Next, deploy ingress to connect the microservices and inject Istio envoys on Flightassist and Weather Microservice.

```bash
kubectl create -f ingress.yaml
kubectl create -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f flightassist.yaml --includeIPRanges=172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16)
```

Congratulations, now your Flightassist application should be running on `http://<isito-ingress IP:Port>`.

## 6.3. Exporing additional features on Istio.

One feature provided by Istio is rate limits. Rate limits can limit the number of accesses from users and prevent your website from getting abused.

To enable this, run

```bash
istioctl mixer rule create global flightassist-service.default.svc.cluster.local -f ratelimit.yaml
```

Now, your rate limit is 50 requests per 10 seconds. Since the flightassist website will use 15-20 requests per visit, you should see your Mixer returns a `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` after you refresh your site 3 to 4 times.

You can learn about other additional features on Istio by clicking [here](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/index.html).

| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [flightassist.js](main_application/flightassist.js)       | Main application, start the express web server and calling the major AJAX functions|
| All JavaScript files (main_application/*.js)         | The implementation of the flightstats and tripIt information, shared by all deployment options |
| [app.py](flightassist-weather/scr/app.py) | Weather Microservice, query and sent weather information to the main application |
| [package.json](main_application/package.json)         | List the packages required by the application |
| [Dockerfile.local](main_application/Dockerfile.local) and [Dockerfile.alpine](flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine) | Description of the Docker image |
| [flightassist.yaml](flightassist.yaml) and [secret.yaml](secret.yaml)| Specification file for the deployment of the service and secret in Kubernetes |
| [ingress.yaml](ingress.yaml)| Specification file for adding flightassist's endpoint to istio-ingress|
| [ratelimit.yaml](ratelimit.yaml) | Specification file for creating rate limits with Istio Mixer|

## Takeaway points
Istio is an addon feature to manage your application traffic. It has to reside on a platform. In addition to the proxy feature we tested in the example, it also provides rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers, policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting functions.

# 7. Deploy Flightassist leveraging OpenWhisk functions

In this scenario, we will deploy Flightassist to use a function that queries the necessary weather data. This shows how you could implement microservices with OpenWhisk. This approach replaces containers with OpenWhisk actions to save space and runtime memory in your cluster. Thanks to OpenWhisk built-in system packages, which includes a weather API, we don't even have to write our own action to implement the weather forecast lookup.

**Important**: You must complete [scenario three: Microservices Kubernetes Clusters](#5-deploy-flightassist-microservices-on-kubernetes-cluster) in order to proceed to the following steps.

First, you want to delete all the services and deployments from the previous scenario.

```bash
kubectl delete -f flightassist.yaml
```

Then, install [OpenWhisk CLI](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/learn/cli) and record the authentication credential for your organization and space.

Next, edit `flightassist_serverless.yaml` and replace the `<namespace>` with your own namespace, `<your-app-end-point-url>` with your node ip and nodeport, and `<your-openwhisk-auth>` with your OpenWhisk authentication. You can run `wsk property get --auth | awk '{print $3}'` to view your OpenWhisk authentication.

Now, let's deploy the new flightassist app with serverless capability

```bash
kubectl create -f flightassist_serverless.yaml
```

Congratulations, now your Flightassist application should be running on `http://<your_node_ip>:30080`. Also, you can learn about [How to Use Flightassist](#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

## Code Structure
| File                                     | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [flightassist.js](main_application/flightassist.js)       | Main application, start the express web server and calling the major AJAX functions|
| [weather.js](main_application/weather.js)       | Trigger actions in OpenWhisk to get the weather information |
| All JavaScript files (main_application/*.js)         | The implementation of the flightstats and tripIt information, shared by all deployment options |
| [package.json](main_application/package.json)         | List the packages required by the application |
| [Dockerfile.local](main_application/Dockerfile.local)         | Description of the Docker image          |
| [flightassist_serverless.yaml](flightassist_serverless.yaml) and [secret.yaml](secret.yaml)| Specification file for the deployment of the service and secret in Kubernetes |

## Takeaway points
In this example, the flightassist app is a perfect use case to use openwhisk:
1. It is an event triggered app, the triggering point is when it is accessed
2. It is a stateless app, there are no sessions to manage
3. It doesn't require persistence
4. It performs a simple function

Many complicated apps are not so easy to be converted into serverless functions.

# How to Use Flightassist

To try out Flightassist, you need to [add a trip on TripIt](https://www.tripit.com/trip/create). Then, add at least one flight for your trip with a departure within the next 24 hours. In your plan, please fill in your confirmation number or airline with flight number.

![Tripit plan](images/plans.png)

Once you added a new plan and you have your Flightassist running, open your Flightassist and click **Authenticate with TripIt** to login to Flightassist.

Now you can see the most recent flight status and weather for all your flights within 24 hours.
