# Deploy Flightassist microservices on Kubernetes Cluster

In this scenario, we use the Flightassist microservices version which runs in two containers. We will run Flightassist as our main application with weather-service as our microservice to query the weather data. Then, we will host those containers using Kubernetes.

First, follow the [Kubernetes Cluster Tutorial](https://github.com/IBM/container-journey-template) to create your own cluster on Bluemix.

Then, install the container registry plugin for Bluemix CLI.

```bash
bx plugin install container-registry -r Bluemix
```
Next, build your own docker images and push them to your own bluemix container registry.

> Replace `<namespace>` with your own namespace, you can view your namespace by running `bx cr namespaces`
>
> If you have an unauthorized error, run `bx cr login` to authorized your container-registry.

```bash
docker build -f main_application/Dockerfile.local -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/flightassist main_application
docker build -f flightassist-weather/Dockerfile.alpine -t registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/weather-service flightassist-weather
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/flightassist
docker push registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/weather-service
```

Then, you need to run the following commands to bind your Cloudant and Weather Insights services to your clusters.

```bash
bx cs cluster-service-bind {your-cluster-name} default mycloudant
bx cs cluster-service-bind {your-cluster-name} default myweatherinsights
```

Next, create secret to give FlightStats and TripIt API credentials for Flightassist. Modify the secret.yaml file with **flightstats-app-id**, **flightstats-app-key**, **tripit-api-key**, and **tripit-api-secret**.

Then, edit the `flightassist.yaml` and replace the ```<namespace>``` with your own namespace. You can obtain your namespace by running `bx cr namespace`. Also replace `<your-app-end-point-url>` with your node ip and nodeport (e.g. 169.47.237.139:30080). You can obtain your IP by running `kubectl get nodes` and your nodeport is 30080.

> Note : If you deployed any servers or deployment from other scenarios, you need to delete them before you proceed to the following steps.
>
> ```bash
> kubectl delete -f flightassist.yaml
> ```

Lastly, run the following commands to deploy the secret and deployment.

```bash
kubectl create -f secret.yaml
kubectl create -f flightassist.yaml
```

Congratulations, now your Flightassist application should be running on `http://<your_node_ip>:30080`. You can go to [How to Use Flightassist](https://github.com/IBM/Microservices-deployment-with-PaaS-Containers-and-Serverless-Platforms#how-to-use-flightassist) and start testing your application.

## Takeaway points
Kubernetes is a powerful orchestration tool. In this example we get a taste of the logical concept of clusters, creating a deployment and service binding. It also has the container networking features built in. However, as a developer, you need to handle building container images and managing images in repositories.
